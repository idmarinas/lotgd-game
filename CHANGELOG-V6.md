-   **Important**:
    -   :warning: Since version 5.0.0 Installer is only via terminal (command: `php bin/console lotgd:install`)
    -   :warning: Avoid, as far as possible, using static classes (e.g. LotgdSetting, Doctrine, LotgdTranslation...) as these classes will be deleted in a future version. Use autowire, dependency injection when possible.
-   **Upgrade/Install for version 5.0.0 and up**
    -   First read [docs](https://github.com/idmarinas/lotgd-game/wiki/Skeleton) and follow steps.
    -   If have problems:
        -   Read info in `storage/log/tracy/*` files, and see the problem.
        -   Read info in `var/log/*` files, and see the problem.
        -   Read info in `var/log/apache2/error.log` (this is the default location in Debian, can change in your OS distribution) in your webserver.
        -   If you can't solve the problem go to: [Repository issues](https://github.com/idmarinas/lotgd-game/issues)

# Version: 6.1.0

### :cyclone: CHANGES

-   **Changes in some files in `public/` folder**
    -   I have reduced the code of these pages to this code:
        ```php
        require_once 'common.php';

        //-- Init page
        \LotgdResponse::pageStart();

        //-- Call controller
        \LotgdResponse::callController('CONTROLLER_NAME');

        //-- Finalize page
        \LotgdResponse::pageEnd();
        ```
    -   _Note_: with this I'm preparing the Core to migrate it to a Symfony App (Routing)
-   **Repository**: Now all class extends `Doctrine\Bundle\DoctrineBundle\Repository\ServiceEntityRepository` and use dependency injection when is necesary.

### :star: FEATURES

-   **Commentary system** 
    -   A translatable comment can now be added so that when this comment is displayed it is translated into the current language of the game.
        -   To add this comment only need add `translation_domain` to comment data array
        -   Example: 
            ```php
            $commentaryService->saveComment([
                'section' => 'any_section',
                'comment' => 'translation.key', //-- Option 1
                // 'comment' => '/me translation.key', //-- Option 2, add a comment with command (any available command can be used)
                //-- Note: No use /grem command, since this command is special for deleting the last comment written by the user.
                'translation_domain' => 'my_domain'
            ]);
            ```
        -   _Note_: With this change the commentary is affected by the language of the game at all times and not only when the commentary is added.
    -   **New command** for comments `/grem` or `:grem` or `::grem` in chat comment and a small horde of Gremlin will delete the last comment you have written as long as it has not been more than 3 minutes.
-   **Occurrence system**
    -   The old and the new event system will work at the same time during the transition.
        -   Activation order
            -   First: activate Occurrence system.
            -   Second: activate the old event system.
                -   Only if Occurrence system is not active.
    -   This system replace old **Special events** in game in version 8.0.0
    -   Zones with this new system:
        - `forest`
        - `gardens`
        - `graveyard`
        - `inn`
        - `village`
            -   All these zones pass four parameters to an event object.
            -   Example for `forest` zone:
            ```php
                $event = \LotgdKernel::get('occurrence_dispatcher')->dispatch('forest', null, [
                    'translation_domain'            => $textDomain,
                    'translation_domain_navigation' => $textDomainNavigation,
                    'route'                         => 'forest.php',
                    'navigation_method'             => 'forestNav',
                ]);
            ```
    -   Can add more occurrences to game only add your occurrences to file:
        ```yaml
            # config/packages/lotgd_occurrence.yaml
            lotgd_occurrence: # Required
                # Prototype
                name: # Name for your occurrance
                    # Probability of activate this event zone. Int 0-10000 (10000 is equal to 100.00%)
                    probability: ~ # Required
                    # Optional: Maximun number of events that can be activated in this zone.
                    max_activation: 2
        ```
    -   Work similar to Symfony Event Dispatcher
        -   Create a subscriber that implements `Lotgd\CoreBundle\OccurrenceBundle\OccurrenceSubscriberInterface` 
            -   Example:
            ```php
                use Lotgd\CoreBundle\OccurrenceBundle\OccurrenceSubscriberInterface;
                use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\GenericEvent;

                class ExampleSubscriber implements OccurrenceSubscriberInterface
                {
                    public function onMessage(GenericEvent $event)
                    {
                        //-- Do something
                    }

                    public static function getSubscribedOccurrences()
                    {
                        return [
                            'forest' => ['onMessage', 10000, OccurrenceSubscriberInterface::PRIORITY_INFO]
                        ];
                    }
                }
            ```
    -   _Note_: [Fairy event](https://github.com/lotgd-core/fairy-bundle) is an first example of usage of this new feature.

                'LotgdLocal:SensitiveEntity' => true,
                'Lotgdcore:SensitiveEntity' => true

    -   Deleted `public/battle.php` not use more in your modules/bundles not work as expected.
    -   Method `fightNav` is part of Battle service
    -   When calculate buffs now use Symfony Expression Language
        -   Modules that use `<module|variable>` replacements for `get_module_pref('variable','module')`
            -   Use `get_module_pref` normaly
        -   Modules that use `<variable>` replacements for `$session['user']['variable']`
            -   Use `character_attr('variable')`
    -   Example:
        ```php
        /** @var \Lotgd\Core\Combat\Battle */
        $serviceBattle = \LotgdKernel::get('lotgd_core.combat.battle');

        //-- Battle zone.
        $serviceBattle
            ->initialize() //--* Initialize the battle
            //-- Configuration
            ->setBattleZone('mine') //-- Battle zone, by default is "forest".
            
            ->battleStart() //--* Start the battle.
            ->battleProcess() //--* Proccess the battle rounds.
            ->battleEnd() //--* End the battle for this petition
            ->battleResults() //--* Add results to response by default (use ->battleResults(true) if you want result results)
        ;

        if ($serviceBattle->isVictory())
        {
            //-- Do anything when victory
        }
        elseif ($serviceBattle->isDefeat())
        {
            //-- Do anything when defeated
        }
        //-- Only show figth navs when not have winner
        elseif ( ! $serviceBattle->battleHasWinner())
        {
            $serviceBattle->fightNav();
        }
        ```
    -   Updated files with new Battle service:
        -   `public/forest.php` 
        -   `public/dragon.php` 
        -   `public/graveyard.php` 
        -   `public/train.php` 
        -   `public/pvp.php` 


### :star: FEATURES

-   **Module/Bundle migrating**
    -   Now `runmodule.php` script work with controllers too. So you can migrate your module to bundle more easy.
        -   Usage:
            -   Create controllers for your new Bundle
            -   If your module use: 
                ```php
                    function MODULE_getmoduleinfo()
                    {
                        return [
                            //....
                            'allowanonymous'      => true,
                            'override_forced_nav' => true,
                            //....
                        ];
                    }
                ```
                -   Replace this with:
                    -   Implement in controller interface `Lotgd\Core\Controller\LotgdControllerInterface` 
                        -   Configure as you need. Remember that this configuration is for ALL methods in controller.
                            -   If  you need some method public and other for user logged, create diferent controllers.
            -   Replace `runmodule.php?module=MODULE_NAME` for `runmodule.php?method=METHOD_NAME&controller=urlencode(CONTROLLER_NAME)`
                ```php 
                    //-- Example
                    $url = 'runmodule.php?method=index&controller='.urlencode(\Lotgd\Local\Controller\ModuleController::class);
                    \LotgdNavigation::addNav('Do anything', $url);
                ```
-   **New console command** Logout all users with inactive sessions `lotgd:user:logout`

### :notebook: NOTES

-   **Important**:
    -   :warning: Since version 5.0.0 Installer is only via terminal (command: `php bin/console lotgd:install`)
    -   :warning: Avoid, as far as possible, using static classes (e.g. LotgdSetting, Doctrine, LotgdTranslation...) as these classes will be deleted in a future version. Use autowire, dependency injection when possible.
-   **Upgrade/Install for version 5.0.0 and up**
    -   First read [docs](https://github.com/idmarinas/lotgd-game/wiki/Skeleton) and follow steps.
    -   If have problems:
        -   Read info in `storage/log/tracy/*` files, and see the problem.
        -   Read info in `var/log/*` files, and see the problem.
        -   Read info in `var/log/apache2/error.log` (this is the default location in Debian, can change in your OS distribution) in your webserver.
        -   If you can't solve the problem go to: [Repository issues](https://github.com/idmarinas/lotgd-game/issues)
