            `3You duck into the small smoke-filled grass hut.
            The pungent aroma makes you cough, attracting the attention of a grizzled old person that does a remarkable job of reminding you of a rock, which probably explains why you didn't notice them until now.
            Couldn't be your failure as a warrior.
            Nope, definitely not.`0`n`n

                `3"`6See you, I do.  Before you did see me, I think, hmm?`0" the old thing remarks.
                "`6Know you, I do; healing you seek.  Willing to heal am I, but only if willing to pay are you.`0"`n`n
                "`5Uh, um.  How much?`0" you ask, ready to be rid of the smelly old thing.`n`n
                The old being thumps your ribs with a gnarly staff. "`6For you... `$`b{healCost,number}´b`0 gold pieces for a complete heal!!`0" it says as it bends over and pulls a clay vial from behind a pile of skulls sitting in the corner.
                The view of the thing bending over to remove the vial almost does enough mental damage to require a larger potion.
                &quot;`6I also have some, erm... 'bargain' potions available,`0&quot; it says as it gestures at a pile of dusty, cracked vials.
                &quot;`6They'll heal a certain percent of your `idamage´i.`0&quot;`0

                `3The old creature glances at you, then in a `^whirlwind of movement`0 that catches you completely off guard, brings its gnarled staff squarely in contact with the back of your head.
                You gasp as you collapse to the ground.`n`n
                Slowly you open your eyes and realize the beast is emptying the last drops of a clay vial down your throat.`n`n
                "`6No charge for that potion.`0" is all it has to say.
                You feel a strong urge to leave as quickly as you can.`0`0
            equal: > # Max HP and Actual HP are equal
                `3The old creature grunts as it looks your way. "`6Need a potion, you do not.  Wonder why you bother me, I do.`0" says the hideous thing.
                The aroma of its breath makes you wish you hadn't come in here in the first place. You think you had best leave.`0
