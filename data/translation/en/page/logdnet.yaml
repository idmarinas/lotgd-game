        `2It should be noted that this list is subject to editing and culling by the administrators of logdnet.logd.com.
        Normally this list is a comprehensive list of all servers that have elected to register with LoGDnet, but I'm making changes to that.
        Because this list is a free service provided by logdnet.logd.com, we reserve the right to remove those who we don't want in the list.`n

            '02': 'Providing deceptive, inappropriate, or false information in the server listing,`n'

            If you've been banned already, chances are you know why, and chances are we've got no interest in removing the ban.
            We provide this free of charge, at the expense of considerable bandwidth and server load, so if you've had the gall to abuse our charity, don't expect it to be won back very easily.`n`n
            If you are well behaved, we don't have an interest in blocking you from this listing. `0`n
