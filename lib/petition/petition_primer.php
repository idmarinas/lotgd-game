output("Also keep in mind that it's more expensive to heal 1 point, then later heal 1 point again than it is to heal 2 in one shot.");
output("So if you're trying to save up some money, and you're barely hurt, you might risk a fight or two while you're a little hurt, and heal the damage from several fights in one shot.`n`n");

output("If you don't log on over the course of an entire game day, you'll miss your opportunity to partake in that game day (this means that new game days are only assigned when you actually log on, being away from the game for a few days won't grant you a whole bunch of new days).");
