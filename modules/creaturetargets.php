// Creature Targeting System for Want of a Better Name v2008-09-23
// By Dan Hall, ImprobableIsland.com
//
// This mod allows you to add up to six specific areas to a monster, for a player to attempt to hit.
// For example, if a player came across a malfunctioning camera or someone with caterpillars in their vagina, they could choose to hit the lens, the camera battery, the caterpillars, or indeed, the vagina.  Yes, these were my test creatures.  It's 4am, give me a break.
// Each hit area is highly customisable.  When the player attempts to strike an area, the creature's Attack or Defence values will fluctuate in that particular round of combat according to what you specify.
// Each hit area has its own bank of hit points, which can be expressed as a value of the creature's starting hitpoints.  When those hitpoints drop to zero, the creature is permanently buffed or debuffed according to your specifications.  Or, you can take away a number of extra hitpoints as a bonus.  Or both.
// Hitting any area will sap the creature's overall hitpoints by the same number as the hitpoints being taken from that specific area.  Hitting the head for 10 damage will take 10 damage from the head and 10 damage from the overall health.
// Hitting "Fight" or any of the automatic fighting buttons will simply attack as normal, with normal stats (altered stats from destroying hitareas notwithstanding).  It is assumed that unless the player says otherwise, he or she is hitting the creature's body.
//
// INSTALLATION
//
// Move the creaturetargetai.php file into your /ai directory.  If this directory doesn't exist, please create it.
//
// The rest is standard procedure.
//
// Please report any bugs you find.  Have fun!
//
// -CMJ
