        <p>IDMarinas Edition part of the base of <b>1.1.2 Dragonprime</b> by Dragonprime Development Team (<a href="http://dragonprime.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DragonPrime</a>) and have code of Oliver Brendel (<a href="http://nb-core.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NB Core</a>).</p>

        <p>With the premise of updating the core of the game without having to start from scratch and bearing in mind that I wanted to keep some compatibility with the previous version. Start developing version <b>2.0.0 IDMarinas Edition</b>. This version is compatible with 99%, it is impossible to guarantee 100% with the <b>1.1.2 Dragonprime version</b>, so you can migrate relatively easily to this new stage of the LotGD core.</p>

        <p>With each new version is migrating to new technologies more modern and discarding others that have remained old. To make each new version of the game's kernel as painless as possible, portions of the kernel are changed in each new version. So with each new version you will only need to review a part of your modules and correct them.</p>

        <p>A list of modules from 1.1.2 Dragonprime that are being updated for the different versions of IDMarinas Edition is provided.</p>

        <p>The most recent *UNSTABLE*  is available from <a href="https://github.com/idmarinas/lotgd-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this repository</a>.
