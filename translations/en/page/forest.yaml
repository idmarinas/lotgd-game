            The Forest, home to evil creatures and evildoers of all sorts.`n`n
            The thick foliage of the forest restricts your view to only a few yards in most places.
            The paths would be imperceptible except for your trained eye.
            You move as silently as a soft breeze across the thick moss covering the ground, wary to avoid stepping on a twig or any of the numerous pieces of bleached bone that populate the forest floor, lest you betray your presence to one of the vile beasts that wander the forest.`n

            `$You approach the blackened entrance of a cave deep in the forest, though the trees are scorched to stumps for a hundred yards all around.
            A thin tendril of smoke escapes the roof of the cave's entrance, and is whisked away by a suddenly cold and brisk wind.
            The mouth of the cave lies up a dozen feet from the forest floor, set in the side of a cliff, with debris making a conical ramp to the opening.
            Stalactites and stalagmites near the entrance trigger your imagination to inspire thoughts that the opening is really the mouth of a great leech.`n`n
            You cautiously approach the entrance of the cave, and as you do, you hear, or perhaps feel a deep rumble that lasts thirty seconds or so, before silencing to a breeze of sulfur-air which wafts out of the cave.
            The sound starts again, and stops again in a regular rhythm.`n`n
            You clamber up the debris pile leading to the mouth of the cave, your feet crunching on the apparent remains of previous heroes, or perhaps hors d'oeuvres.`n`n
            Every instinct in your body wants to run, and run quickly, back to the warm inn, and the even warmer {partner}.`n
            What do you do?`0
