            All of them promise to let you talk with the deceased, and most of them surprisingly seem to work.
            There are also rumors that the gypsy have the power to speak over distances other than just those of the afterlife.
            In typical gypsy style, the old woman sitting behind a somewhat smudgy crystal ball informs you that the dead only speak with the paying.
