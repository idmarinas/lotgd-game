            All around the walls of the lobby are various doors which lead to various clan halls.
            The doors each possess a variety of intricate mechanisms which are obviously elaborate locks designed to be opened only by those who have beeneducated on how to operate them.
            Nearby, you watch another warrior glance about nervously to make sure no one is watching before touching various levers and knobs on the door.
