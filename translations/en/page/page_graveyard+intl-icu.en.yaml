            Your spirit wanders into a lonely graveyard, overgrown with sickly weeds which seem to grab at your spirit as you float past them.
            Around you are the remains of many broken tombstones, some lying on their faces, some shattered to pieces.
            You can almost hear the wails of the souls trapped within each plot lamenting their fates.`n`n
            In the center of the graveyard is an ancient looking mausoleum which has been worn by the effects of untold years.
            A sinister looking gargoyle adorns the apex of its roof; its eyes seem to follow  you, and its mouth gapes with sharp stone teeth.
            The plaque above the door reads `${graveyardOwnerName}`0, Overlord of Death.`0

            You enter the mausoleum and find yourself in a cold, stark marble chamber.
            The air around you carries the chill of death itself.
            From the darkness, two black eyes stare into your soul.
            A clammy grasp seems to clutch your mind, and fill it with the words of the Overlord of Death, `${graveyardOwnerName}`0 himself.`n`n
            "`7Your mortal coil has forsaken you. Now you turn to me.
            There are those within this land that have eluded my grasp and possess a life beyond life.
            To prove your worth to me and earn my favor, go out and torment their souls.
            Should you gain enough of my favor, I will reward you.`0`0"

                `${graveyardOwnerName}`0`) sighs and mumbles something about, "`7just 'cause they're dead, does that mean they don't have to think?`0"`n`n
                Perhaps you'd like to actually `ineed´i restoration before you ask for it.`0
