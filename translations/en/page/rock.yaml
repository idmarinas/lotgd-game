            `n`n`4Something in you compels you to examine the curious rock.  Some dark magic, locked up in age old horrors.`n`n
            When you arrive at the rock, an old scar on your arm begins to throb in succession with a mysterious light that now seems to come from the rock.
            As you stare at it, the rock shimmers, shaking off an illusion.  You realize that this is more than a rock.
            It is, in fact, a doorway, and over the threshold you see others bearing an identical scar to yours.
            It somehow reminds you of the head of one of the great serpents from legend.`n`n
            You have discovered The Veteran's Club.`n`n
