    `n`nYou walk through a gate and on to one of the many winding paths that makes its way through the well-tended gardens.
    From the flowerbeds that bloom even in darkest winter, to the hedges whose shadows promise forbidden secrets, these gardens provide a refuge for those seeking out the Green Dragon; a place where they can forget their troubles for a while and just relax.`n`n
    One of the fairies buzzing about the garden flies up to remind you that the garden is a place for roleplaying and peaceful conversation, and to confine out-of-character comments to the other areas of the game.`n`n
