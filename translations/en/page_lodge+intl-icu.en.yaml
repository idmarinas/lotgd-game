            `7You follow a narrow path away from the stables and come across a rustic Hunter's Lodge.
            A guard stops you at the door and asks to see your membership card.`0`n`n

                `7Upon showing it to him, he says, `3&quot;Very good {sex,select, 1{ma'am} other{sir}}, welcome to the J. C. Petersen Hunting Lodge.
                You have earned `^{donationPoints,number}`0 points and have `^{donationPointsAvailable,number}`0 points available to spend,"`7 and admits you in.`n`n
                You enter a room dominated by a large fireplace at the far end.
                The wood-panelled walls are covered with weapons, shields, and mounted hunting trophies, including the heads of several dragons that seem to move in the flickering light.`n`n
                Many high-backed leather chairs fill the room.
                In the chair closest to the fire sits J. C. Petersen, reading a heavy tome entitled "Alchemy Today."`n`n
                As you approach, a large hunting dog at his feet raises her head and looks at you.
                Sensing that you belong, she lays down and goes back to sleep.`0`n`n

            `n"`&But what are points,`7" you ask?
            Points can be redeemed for various advantages in the game.
            You'll find access to these advantages in the Hunter's Lodge.
            As time goes on, more advantages will likely be added, which can be purchased when they are made available.`n`n

            You can also gain contributor points for contributing in other ways that the administration may specify.
            So, don't despair if you cannot send cash, there will always be non-cash ways of gaining contributor points.`n`n
